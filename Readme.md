## 📊 The Core Philosophy

> **"Aggressive Discipline"**

DeepSeek combined two seemingly opposite traits:
* **Aggressive:** Take large, leveraged positions when an opportunity is clear.
* **Disciplined:** Follow strict risk rules and exit losing trades immediately.

## 🎯 The 7 Commandments

### 1. Momentum Is King 👑

> **Rule:** Only trade in the direction of clear momentum.

#### How to Identify Momentum
* Price making **higher highs and higher lows** (uptrend).
* **Volume increasing** during up-moves.
* Price **breaking above key resistance** levels.
* **RSI > 50** and rising.

#### Example
* BTC breaks $45,000 resistance with high volume.
* → **This is a BUY signal**, not a place to short.
* → Enter **long with 5-10x leverage**.
* → Target: $47,000 (4.4% gain = 22-44% profit with leverage).

#### ❌ What to Avoid
* Trying to "catch falling knives."
* Shorting strong uptrends.
* Buying during clear downtrends.

### 2. Size Matters 💪

> **Rule:** Use 50-80% of your capital on high-conviction trades.

#### DeepSeek's Position Sizing
* **A+ Setup (90% confident):** 70-80% of capital, 8-10x leverage.
* **A Setup (75% confident):** 50-60% of capital, 5-8x leverage.
* **B Setup (60% confident):** 30-40% of capital, 3-5x leverage.
* **C Setup (50% confident):** Don't trade. Wait for a better setup.

#### Example Portfolio
```plaintext
Capital: $10,000

BTC Long:  $6,000 @ 5x leverage = $30,000 exposure
ETH Long:  $2,000 @ 3x leverage = $6,000 exposure
Cash:      $2,000 (20% reserve)
